00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.800
So, so you think you can tell

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.600
Heaven from hell

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.000
Blue skies from pain

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.600
Can you tell a green field

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.200
From a cold steel rail?

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.200
A smile from a veil?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.500
Do you think you can tell?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.500
Did they get you to trade

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.100
Your heroes for ghosts?

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.800
Hot ashes for trees?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.500
Hot air for a cool breeze?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.300
Cold comfort for change?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.400
And did you exchange

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.650
A walk on part in the war

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.900
For a lead role in a cage?

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.600
How I wish, how I wish you were here

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.400
We're just two lost souls

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.200
Swimming in a fish bowl

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.700
Year after year

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.500
Running over the same old ground

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.850
And how we found

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.800
The same old fears

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.900
Wish you were here

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.800
How I wish, how I wish you were here

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.850
We're just two lost souls

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.900
Swimming in a fish bowl

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.400
Year after year

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.900
Running over the same old ground

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.350
And how we found

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.600
The same old fears

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.700
Wish you were here
